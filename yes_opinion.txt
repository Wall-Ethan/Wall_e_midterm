This is the file for opinion for only online schooling.

the reason schooling should switch to only online learning is because it is 
more conveniant and easy for the students, as all knowledge from the classes will be avalible
at all times. 
This also means teachers will have a better time with handeling work as it they will
just simpley have to post assignments for students to do from text/computer files, the online exsperiance
will also allow assignments to be graded instantly in terms of question based tests.
