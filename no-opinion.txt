This is the file against only online schooling.

The reason why we should still have school be an in person process is because.
learning in person allows students to be more personal with there teachers
whitch lets students be more comfortuble and makes it easier for them to ask questions 
whitch in term allows them to make more progress in there studies, 
not to metion it lets them devolope there social skills more as it lets them interact with other students more,
whether that be in or out of class.
It provides convenience for teachers to cause it lets them help the students and phiscally see what problems they have.
